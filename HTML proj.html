                <h3>The story is amazing and very well written</h3>
                <ol>
                    <em><li style="color:white">The story is unique to the games coming before it while still sticking with the original games' tropes.</li>
                        <li style="color:white">Each character has a distinct, loveable, and identifiable personality.</li>
                        <li style="color:white">The story is well-balanced with saddening story lines and fun tropes. </li>
